    This main function creates a PersonList object and populates it
    with the contents of a data file containing 30 records each
    containing the first name and birthdate as month day year
    separated by commas:  Merli,9,10,1998

    Next, a request is made to search for a certain Person.
    A Person object is created from the input.
    Then a linear search is performed with the Person object
    If the Person is located in the list, its index is returned
    Otherwise, -1 is returned.
    The number of compares for the linear search is displayed

    Next, a bubble sort is executed to sort the PersonList.
    The sorted list is displayed, along with the number of
    compares it took to sort it

    Next, a request is made to search for another Person.
    A Person object is created from the input.
    Then a binary search is performed with the Person object
    If the Person is located in the sorted list, its index is returned
    Otherwise, -1 is returned.
    The number of compares for the binary search is displayed
